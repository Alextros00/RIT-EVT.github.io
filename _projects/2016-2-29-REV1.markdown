REV1
====================
The RIT Electric Vehicle 1, or REV1, is the pinnacle of the Electric Vehicle Team's effort to design, build, and race a high performance electric motorcycle for competition in the 2016 eMotoRacing all-electric race series. The current bike is based off of the frame from a 2005 Kawasaki Ninja ZX6RR, and utilizes a Zero Z-Force 75-7 motor paired with a Sevcon Size 6 controller. In house engineering includes the design and fabrication of a battery management system, battery containment modules, structural framing for the mounting of the powertrain, as well as advanced data collection and analysis software.
 
REV1 Improvements
=====================
Currently, the team is working on improving mechanical aspects of REV1. The two projects, sub-frame redesign and motor relocation, will improve the performance and prevent further issues from arising with the current design.

### Sub-Frame Redesign

The current sub-frame houses the motor controller, and the design served its purpose during the race. The lower part of the sub-frame hangs lower than originally designed, and runs the risk of colliding with the rear wheel if the suspension were to compress fully. This would cause a lot of problems if this were to occur during a race, so the design needs improvement. The members of this project are involved in designing a custom sub-frame that could house the motor controller without the risk of the previous design.

### Motor Relocation

In the present design, the motor drives the rear wheel through a jack-shaft. After the first race, the team realized the jack-shaft was over-heating and stripping the grease off of the chain, preventing the chain from operating properly. In order to avoid this issue, the team is working on relocating the motor so that it is directly in line with the rear wheel, eliminating the need for a jack-shaft.
