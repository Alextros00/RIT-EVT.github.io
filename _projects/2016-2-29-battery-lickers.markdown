##The Battery Lickers Electric Bicycle Project

The Battery Lickers are one of two electric bicycle projects hosted by the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Electric Vehicle Team. The project was created as an introduction to both the technical and organizational elements of the team intended for new and unexperienced members. Provided with a bicycle, batteries, and a kit containing the throttle, motor controller, and motor, the project team was initially tasked with assembling and testing the functionality their components. 
	
After the first couple meetings, The Battery Lickers had completed initial assembly and successfully tested the basic functionality of the newly constructed electric bicycle. Pleased with the results of the test, the Battery Lickers were then given the project’s main challenge. 

**Three criteria were to be met:**

>1. Encase all electrical components in a water resistant enclosure
>1. Implement a kill switch to cut all power in the event of an emergency
>1. Present all designs and ideas periodically to a design review board made up of fellow club members and work with them to obtain constructive criticism to improve the design.

The Battery Lickers’ response was so enthusiastic, that sub groups needed to be formed in order to allow each individual the opportunity to communicate their ideas and be heard. Multiple sub teams were formed including mechanical, electrical, aesthetics, and special projects. Every meeting, a group discussion is completed in which each sub team updates the group on their current status as well as any difficult challenges which hinder progression. If able, the entire team will assist in overcoming the challenge so the project will continue on track. 

**Sub Teams** 

>* Mechanical: Design and fabricate the main enclosure for the electrical components
>* Electrical: Design and implement lighting systems, kill switch, and low voltage cutoff.
>* Aesthetics: Design and fabricate an artificial body for the bike to improve its appearance
>* Special Projects: Work on anything not covered by another team. Currently working on a 3-D printed inductive lighting project for the bike’s wheels.

Other than meeting our criteria listed above and learning as much as possible throughout the process, the Battery Lickers’ main goal for the project is to proudly display their finished result at Imagine RIT in the spring of 2016 to inspire future generations and earn credit to the Rochester Institute of Technology’s Electric Vehicle Team name.
