The Project
=================

Not Your Dad’s E-Bike is one of the two electric bicycle teams this year. The team is mainly comprised of first year students who are looking for a hands on approach to learning about electric vehicles. Headed by  Electrical Engineering student Blake Cymerys and Industrial Design student Daniel Shapiro, the team works closely with more experienced club members to gain an understanding of what is needed to make an electric vehicle. 

Given a regular bicycle, a hub motor, a few odds and ends, and a budget of $200, it was up to the team to design a practical and possibly marketable electric bicycle. After setting customer requirements such as  going fast, having a long battery life, being weather resistant, and being reasonably inexpensive, the team proceeded to determine more precise engineering specifications that the bike would need to have. These included such features and specifications as a low voltage cut-off, comfortable ergonomics, a low center of gravity, and a top speed of approximately 23 miles per hour with a 30 minute / 10 mile range.  This information was presented to the club officers along with initial design mockups, an estimated cost breakdown and a project timeline in the first design review.

The initial design featured three 14.5V four cell Lithium-ion batteries and a motor controller in a wooden housing in the frame of the bike (above). The box would be clamped to the frame on two sides and it proved to be an infeasible solution after testing, so a more durable box would be made of fiberglass or sheet metal.  

Challenges began right away with the hub motor. Aside from the mismatched tires, the new wheel was too large to fit in the frame of the bike unmodified. After the addition of a few spacers to the frame and a matching road tire salvaged from a previous team project, the bike was sleek and ready for a center housing to bring it all together.

After several weeks of planning and research into how the new box should look, the team was ready to present their updated design to the officers. The second design review brought with it new features the team hoped to incorporate into the bike such as a backlit acrylic window for the aluminum containment box, a pedal powered headlight and taillight, and a weather proof external wiring harness.  The  wiring harness would be a challenge to design and make, but having the ability to charge the batteries without opening the housing would be worth the effort. Charged with this task Blake, Larissa, Jake and Andrew Nguyen got to work designing a custom connector. 

Although having a lot of great features presented the team with motivation and stretch goals, the main priority was to have a functional bike. At this point all other progress was ceased due to a technical complication with the motor controller. While attempting a thermal diagnostic test on our wooden mockup (mid left), a power wire failed, destroying the motor controller and frying the sensors that made the hub motor work. This literally immobilized the bike and the project altogether.  In order to stay on schedule, Alan and Andrew Eberhard took initiative and were determined to fix the motor. Afterall, if we could not repair it, we would have to use our whole budget (and then some) to replace it, especially since the motor controller was beyond repair.

On initial inspection, it looked like one of the hall-effect sensor wires had simply been mutilated in the test and was making a bad connection. After disassembling it and fixing the connections, the problem wasn’t resolved (below right). At this point it was pretty clear that it wasn’t the wires, but the sensors themselves. Working tirelessly during the vast majority of their Saturday night and Sunday morning, the tiny $1 sensors had been replaced and the motor reassembled, which saved the team approximately $196 and restored faith in our e-bike.

The team then got to work refining the box design and manufacturing it however was most economical. This ended up involving a local company, TCS Industries, and they donated a beautiful box for us to work with (below). After winter break, the team arrived back in Rochester and is excited to keep making progress on the bike.
