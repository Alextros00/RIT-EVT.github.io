In order to update the officer and other photos you need to look no farther!

On a windows machine:

download github desktop
either sign into or create a github account

get the RIT-EVT.github.io onto your machine

go to the GitHub\RIT-EVT.github.io\assets\img\team folder
move the old photos to the "old photos"
add the new photos to the assets/img/team folder
be sure to name the photos name.png or name.jpg
the images cannot be name.CR2 the file size is too large

then go back to GitHub\RIT-EVT.github.io and navigate to the index.html file

search the page for 'EDIT HERE'

Look at the h4 tag to determine what postion needs to be filled in there
from here you want to edit:
	the image src or image source
	the alt with the persons name
	the persons name in the h3 tag
	their email replaced where the old email is
	
Repeat the editing of all of the slides.
	This should be the members that need to be accesible to the public aka officers and sponsorship
