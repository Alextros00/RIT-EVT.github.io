            <p>
                The RIT Electric Vehicle Team (EVT) is a student-run organization dedicated
                to promoting the viability of electric vehicles through real-world demonstrations of
                electric drivetrains in action. The team has designed and build a fully electric
                superbike that is raced in events at the professional level.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team is all inclusive and is comprised of majors including engineering,
                industrial design, computer science, and business, among others. Many members
                join the team as Freshman, working on e-bike projects and intermediary projects
                to assist in the development of their analysis, design, manufacturing, and testing
                skill sets. The next step involves contributing to projects directly related
                to the superbike, allowing the team to utilize the application of these refined
                skills. Many members quickly become team leaders and are integrated into the
                team's leadership program, which teaches them to work with sub-teams to integrate
                new designs and features while understanding management principles. Overall, we
                are able to utilize these leadership skills to further develop the team and provide
                members structured development feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the overall goal of the team involves the successful design of our superbike,
                we value the knowledge we are able to provide our team members. Knowledge is an
                invaluable tool that our team members utilize to obtain co-ops during schooling
                and full time jobs upon RIT graduation. We utilize extra resources to "reinvent
                the wheel," as it provides an unparalleled learning experience and allows us to
                push current technologies to the limit. The superbike project is a continuous
                learning experience that provides new challenges and opportunities for our
                members to propose new ideas that will take us into the future of electric vehicles.

                        The electrical team is responsible for all custom circuit
                        design and electrical system integration for the superbike.
                        Major projects include the design and development of the
                        Battery Management System (BMS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU),
                        Low Voltage Subsystem (LVSS), and the Supercharger. For more

                        The mechanical team is responsible for the design of various
                        components on the motorcycle, as well as the integration of
                        everything inside the frame. On REV1, the mechanical team used
                        a Creaform 3D scanner to create a virtual representation of the
                        bike that was used for the design of battery and motor mounting.
                        The most recent project involved the design and manufacturing of
                        new battery packs utilizing cylindrical cells. The mechanical
                        team continuously maintains the superbike, ensuring peak
                        competition performance.

                        The firmware team is a multidisciplinary design team
                        dedicated to building the software systems required to field a
                        competitive race vehicle. The BMS, IMU, and Supercharger all
                        require extensive firmware development to ensure proper
                        functionality. A subset of the firmware team is currently
                        responsible for designing and maintaining REV1's gateway, which
                        aggregates and records data from the CAN bus. Data collection
                        from each device on REV1 allows the team to monitor the health
                        of the bike and ensure proper behavior.
