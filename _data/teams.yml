    The mechanical team designs and manufactures the drivetrain components for 
    the electric superbike. We use tools such as Solidworks and Creaform 3D 
    scanning technology to model and conduct simulations of our designs. We are 
    responsible for the assembly and maintenance of the motorcycle. We are 
    currently scanning the whole motorcycle by individual components to create 
    an accurate CAD model. This model will be used to determine the mounting 
    position for the motor and batteries by using the mounting holes on the OEM 
    frame. The mechanical team is also currently fabricating the parts for 
    custom battery modules. The battery containment boxes have been engineered 
    to withstand the abuse of high speed racing and collision.

    The Electrical team is composed of several sub-teams working to develop new 
    technologies for use on any of our electric vehicle platforms. Collectively, 
    we cover a wide variety of applications including battery management, data 
    acquisition and performance analysis.

    The Firmware team is responsible for the design and implementation of all 
    of the software on our vehicles. We design a wide variety of features with 
    a variety of platforms and programming languages, from drivers on our BMS 
    to the network interfaces on our Super Bike. We work closely with the 
    Electrical team on the design of many of our custom boards, and the 
    Software team to integrate all of our controllers with the many external 
    services that we use. Our current members are from broad backgrounds 
    including CE, EE, CS, SE, and more. We are constantly taking on projects 
    that involve all skill levels, and are more than willing to help teach 
    anyone who wants to learn. We exist to get people more involved and 
    knowledgeable about electric vehicle technology and firmware development.
