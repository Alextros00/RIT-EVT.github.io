The founders thought that the best way to learn about the technology we would need to use in the motorcycle was by completing a series of intermediate projects to learn about the different complexities of electric vehicles. The first vehicle they constructed was an electric moped, named \"Hellboy.\" You can probably find some pictures of it on our page if you go back far enough. This project was before my time, but I do know some of its details. It uses a PMG Perm 132 Brushed DC motor in conjunction with an Alltrax AXE motor controller, and is powered by 15 hobby LiPo packs. The battery can either be arranged in a 20 series 3 parallel configuration, or a 12 series 5 parallel configuration. The biggest challenges that they found in this project were having a reliable mechanical frame, and maintaining the lithium ion batteries. The frame was a big issue because it was from the 1980s, and not in the greatest of conditions. The brakes were bad, and the wheels didn't really mount as securely to the axles as you would have liked. From this, we learned to always start with quality components. I'm just going to dedicate a whole section here to lithium ion cells here, because that's probably the most important part of EV's.\n\nOn Hellboy, the battery pack was such a large issue because of the inherent danger of lithium ion cells. You always have to ensure that the voltage of each cell is at a safe level. Generally they should always be kept between 4.2 and 3 Volts per cell at worst. For best life, they should be kept between 4.15 and 3.2 Volts per cell. This should ideally be maintained by a BMS, but on Hellboy, they relied only on balance charging to do this. That means that while the pack was in use, there was not active monitoring of the voltage. The only means that they had of shutting down the pack was by an undervoltage setting on the motor controller (it would shut down if the pack voltage got too low). This is an okay way of protecting cells, but if one cell drops faster than the rest then you run the risk of destroying it before the pack voltage in whole is too low. To combat this problem, we wanted to use an always-active bms on the motorcycle. Being a student team, we decided to learn about them and design our own. Our bms is intended to monitor and control the voltage of each cell in the battery pack during charging and rest. During discharge, it doesn't have the power to maintain voltages as equal, but it can shut down power if one cell voltage becomes too low. Another important part of using lithium ion cells is being able to monitor their state of charge. The voltage vs SOC graph isn't linear, and the voltage tends to sag (drop) during discharge. These things make it inaccurate to monitor your battery capacity via voltage alone. We, and any other advanced electric vehicle you find, monitors its state of charge via \"coulomb counting.\" I'm not sure if you're familiar with this, but it's a method of tracking the energy that goes into and out of your battery pack. It's done by running the current of the EV through a current shunt (a very precisely calibrated, high-current resistor) and measuring the voltage drop across the resistor. You know the voltage and resistance of the shunt, so you can calculate the current flow on the vehicle at any given time. A microcontroller is then used to sum the energy into or out of the pack so that you know at any given time how much energy you have left to use. Our bms was built to perform this task as well. In a mechanical sense, lithium ion cells are dangerous because of their instability. They need to be protected from puncture, cooled enough to maintain operating temperature, and in some cases, compressed. If you've never seen a youtube video of someone puncturing a cell, i'd highly recommend it. It will definitely motivate you to want to build a safe battery pack. Essentially, it will ignite spontaneously, release toxic fumes, and be nigh on impossible to put out. To prevent puncture from happening on our motorcycle pack, we encased all of the cells in a fully enclosed sheet aluminum box, and added foam in places where the cells came near edges. This prevented any rocks or other debris from flying up from the pack and accidentally puncturing the cells. By doing this, however, we made it challenging to keep the pack cool because of how difficult it is is to extract heat from the inside of a box, especially with foam interrupting the contact between cells and aluminum. To combat this problem, we opted to insert a \"phase change\" material between every other cell in the pack. This is a \"wax impregnated graphite matrix\" that melts at 48C and takes advantage of the fact that material temperature is constant during melting to keep the cells cool. Basically, once the pack reaches 48C, the phase change material begins to \"melt\" (the graphite matrix allows it to keep its shape in melted form) and absorbs the heat energy from the cells. If you've taken a thermo class, you know that it takes far more energy to change phase of a material than it does to heat it up. We ran simulations on the pack to ensure that in the worst case scenario, the pack would be dead by the time the phase change material finished melting. This is only one method of cooling cells, and there are certainly others that will work just as well if not better. Our main motivations for using it were to be able to have a fully enclosed module and not need to use complicated and heavier liquid cooling systems. The reason why it's so important to keep cells cool is for safety. The cells we used on the motorcycle (XALT 63 AH HP, which are NMC chemistry) had a rated operating temperature of up to 60C. Above this, they were in danger of entering a thermal runaway condition, where the energy released by the cells as heat grows at such a rate that it can't be contained (this results in the entire pack going up in flames). In actuality, the temperature that runaway begins to occur is higher than 60C, but we designed to this spec to make sure our bases were covered. It's also better for the longevity of the cells to charge and discharge them within the rated operating temperature. One other thing that we learned from talking to XALT is that the performance of prismatic cells is better if you compress them at their faces. They recommended 4 psi, and this is what we designed too. Essentially what we did was put the entire stack of cells between two aluminum plates that were clamped together.\n\nIf you're interested, you can look at a bunch of the more mechanical stuff about the bike at http://www.coroflot.com/JeffBotticello/REV1-Electric-Superbike-EVT. I'm not electrical, so I don't have anything about the bms, but there are some pictures of the battery pack in there. \n\nI didn't realize how long I could write about batteries for, but apparently it's a pretty long time haha. Let me know if you have any questions about the stuff I wrote about, or other stuff in general. I'm sure there's plenty more I could talk about that I'm not thinking of right now.",
